# Control-Engineering-Projects
Involves applications of control systems design techniques for modelling and characterisation of open loop control systems and closed loop systems. System modelling  focused on steady-state investigations and prediction of system response using suitable methods such as the Root Locus Design Method and Nyquist Plot Design Method.
